# Navigation Component

## Reason:

Navigation component in android let's us set up a flow of navigaiton in
in the application. This can done beneficial to multi-activity/multi-fragment 
or multi-activity/fragment based apps. 

Using a navigation graph, we can create a navigation flow of the fragments
to create an app journey. This can be accomplished using the back-stack.

The back-stack lets us operate the views as in a stack. Therefore, you can
use up to go back to the previous view. All the way back to the android launcher
or any other app open at the time of using. 

## Principles of Navigation:

  * First Principle: There's always a starting place.
  * Second Principle: You can always go back.
  * Third Principle: Up goes back (mostly).
